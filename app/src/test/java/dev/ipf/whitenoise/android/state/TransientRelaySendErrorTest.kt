/**
 * Regression coverage for issue #294: sending a message occasionally failed
 * with a "relays not connected"-style error even when relays were reachable a
 * moment later.
 *
 * Root cause: a publish that began during a *transient* relay-pool gap (socket
 * teardown mid-reconnect on a doze wake / network change) saw an empty or
 * still-handshaking pool at the single instant it fanned out, and the Nostr
 * transport returned a connect timeout. `ConversationController.send()`
 * surfaced that first failure as a hard, user-visible "send failed" instead of
 * giving the pool a brief window to (re)connect and retrying.
 *
 * The fix retries the send across a bounded budget ([SEND_RETRY_ATTEMPTS]) but
 * ONLY for failures [isTransientRelaySendError] classifies as *connect-phase*
 * connectivity — the cases that prove the event never reached a relay.
 *
 * IDEMPOTENCY CONTRACT (adversarial review of PR #299): the retry re-enters the
 * high-level FFI send (`sendText`/`replyToMessage`), and the Marmot runtime
 * builds a brand-new inner app event per call. So the classifier must reject any
 * ambiguous *post-send* failure where the first event may already have reached a
 * relay — otherwise a lost/late ack would make us republish a second distinct
 * event and peers would see a duplicate message. These tests pin both halves:
 * connect-phase failures are retried; post-send/ambiguous and terminal failures
 * are not.
